# Iffy Tasks
## TODO
- Update declarations ***Iffy***
	- Modify constant, type and variable to meet the language spec
	- To assist the semantic phase, if there is more than one identifier declared in a single Quby var declaration, then each one should be output with an sVar token, for example
- Modify the string type - ***Iffy***
	- Add new operators in the required precedence rules
- Syntactic details ***Iffy***
	- Replace pColonEquals with pAssignEquals
	- Everything else **should** be fine.

## DONE
